# Call-Center-Power-Bi-Analysis

<p1> Introduction
In this project, I have done the analysis on the call center dataset. For the analysis, I write 5 KPIs, created charts, filters and finally created 2 pages interactive Power Bi report.
The call centers are situated in four cities and these centers have four mediums to listen and solve customer's queries i.e. Calls, Chatbot, E-mail and Web. Sentiments(experience of the call) data of the customers are also there for the analysis with the date and reason of the call.
